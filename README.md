# STEC Tools and Protocols
In this repo you will find the protocols used to analyse platforms investigated in the STEC (https://stec.design/) project. 
A tool and seperate script is also included which can be used as part of the textual analysis. This tool helps you to create a poster containing the most frequently found words.
